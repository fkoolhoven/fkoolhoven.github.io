I am currently working on this project so it's not finished yet!

# About the project
A project I am currently working on as part of the CFG course in web development. I created an interactive fow field that let's you manipulate different paramaters through pressing keys on your keyboard. It lets you create your own art. This is a work in progress; I am still adding effects and want to add sound effects as well.
